# Passive readout board for TCT

This repo contains the source files of a *4 channels passive readout board for TCT* which has incorporated a digital temperature and humidity sensor and is "Peltier friendly"ยน such that the temperature can be accurately controlled. The design is in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). This board was designed, produced and used for the characterization of TI-LGADs.

## Footnotes

ยน I mean that it has a flat surface that can easily be put in contact with a Peltier cell, in addition to the temperature sensor.
